        <p>From a very early age I was fascinated by games — at first it was Warcraft II, Blood, and Command & Conquer. Later that shifted to Warcraft III and Counter-Strike, but what truly captured my heart were multiplayer games — Dota, Lineage, Ragnarok Online, FF14, and eventually World of Warcraft.</p>
        <p>Sometimes I try mobile games that hook me for one reason or another. The most recent was AFK Journey, which has incredible visuals and a compelling core loop that keeps you coming back every day.</p>
        <p>I like a systematic approach to everything, so I don’t just play games — I study their mechanics and systems. I’m also a big fan of Dungeons & Dragons 5e, whose rules I’ve learned thoroughly.</p>
        <p>After joining Wargaming I realized once and for all that I don’t want to do anything other than game development. So right now my growth is fully focused on game design and building prototypes in Unreal Engine 5 as my main engine. I also plan to return to Unity to refresh the basics for rapid prototyping, and to learn Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) to broaden my horizons.</p>
        <p>My technical university background and prior experience in various IT roles help me pick up new technologies quickly, so I consider myself someone who can switch between them with ease.</p>
